    # The streaming spark context and our code and the tasks that are spawned all
    # work concurrently. To ensure a clean shut down we use this semaphore.
    # The main thread will first acquire the only permit available and then try
    # to acquire another one right after spinning up the streaming computation.
    # The second tentative at acquiring the semaphore will make the main thread
    # wait on the call. Then, in the `foreachRDD` call, when the stopping condition
    # is met we release the semaphore, basically giving "green light" to the main
    # thread to shut down the computation.
    # We cannot call `ssc.stop()` directly in `foreachRDD` because it might lead
    # to deadlocks.
